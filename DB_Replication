System Design : DB replication :

Requirement : 

There is a company , that operates 30 regional databases, all sharing the same schema.

Each region exposes a REST API that serves committed row-level changes. This API:

Accepts parameters sequenceId and size.

and Returns up to size transactions, starting from sequenceId, in ascending order.

Each transaction contains all mutated records (inserts, updates, deletes) within that transaction.


We need to build a system that continuously replicates all changes from every region into a central Oracle database, storing the data into unified logical tables (i.e., single table per entity type shared by all regions).

Note : Since duplicates or concurrent writes are possible, the system must handle primary key conflicts deterministically and ensure no data corruption.
